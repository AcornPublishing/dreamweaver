This short tutorial looks at a very basic pinhole camera. I can't remember exactly where I saw the design, maybe from another site but it's a cracker and it works. All you'll need for this is two plastic film canisters (the kind that 35 mm film comes in), a scalpel and some sticky tape - and of course some standard multi-grade black-and-white photographic paper. 

First take the lid off one of the canisters and slice the bottom off.

Then cut a 5mm section from the center so it looks like the piece in the picture on the right. 

In the dark apply a piece of rolled over tape to the back of a 3cm by 3cm piece of photographic paper (make sure it's not on the light sensitive shiny side)

Put the pieces together (all in the dark remember) as shown in the animation.

Finally rotate the 'shutter' until it covers the hole and you're ready to step out and take a photo.

Operate the camera by holding steadily on a surface with one finger and rotating the shutter to expose the paper for a few seconds before sliding closed again.
